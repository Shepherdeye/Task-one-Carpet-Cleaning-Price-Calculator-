<h3>Why the output of equation=  $30.00 ?</h3>
<p> 
Because we used a Standard Numeric Format type "C" (Currency) and it appear the dollar sign "$" . 
</p>
<br>
<h3>what is its benefit ?</h3>
<p> 
Standard Numeric Format helps us control how the output appears, whether it's a currency, percentage, decimal, or other numeric type.
</p>
<br>
<h3>the other example</h3>
<p> 
  double studentPoints = 400;
  <br>
 int totalPoints = 410;
  <br>
 double percentage = studentPoints / totalPoints;
  <br>
 Console.WriteLine($"Percentage: ={percentage:P}");
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  
  <strong>Result => 
  Percentage: = 97.56% </strong>
  
</p>
